			<h2>PhD Student, Department of Computer Science</h2>
			<p>I'm a PhD student working with <a class="slide_description_link" href="https://randleslab.pratt.duke.edu">Amanda Randles</a> on personalized computational fluid dynamics simulations of the human circulatory system.</p>			
			<p>My interests include parallel computing and medicine.</p>
			<p>Before Duke I spent 5 years working with several startups as a full-stack software developer. During my professional career I became increasingly interested in medical/healthcare applications 
			and started the development studio <a class="slide_description_link" href="http://www.digitalclinix.com">Digital Clinix</a> through which I collaborated with medical researchers from Harvard, NYU, Yale, and USCD on algorithmic decision making software that
			helps clinicians choose safer, more effective treatments for their patients.</p>
			<p>Below is a collection of projects I worked in the preceding 5 years. Each an invaluable experience where I made close friends and had the opportunity to tackle technical challenges.</p>

			<h1>Flow</h1>
			<h2>Creator and developer</h2>
			<p>Seeing the impact of <i>Aspirin Guide</i> and <i>MenoPro</i> and the struggle of clinicians to follow a growing number of complex, frequently changing medical guidelines, I began work on <i>Flow</i>. With <i>Flow</i>, creating helpful clinical decision-support tools doesn't require programming or obscure technical skills. Using its simple drag & drop interface you build intuitive flow chart models of your decision-making algorithm. Flow then automatically converts your model into a fully functional application that you can share instantly as a website or iOS/Android app. The output application is HTML/JavaScript so can be shared almost anywhere.</p>	
			<p><i>Flow</i> itself is written in JavaScript and HTML.</p>
